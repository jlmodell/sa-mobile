This is a site built using react and was a learning experience on mobile-first design.

The intent was to include a picker, charts and a datatable and I wanted them to react to the picker's parameters.

The user logs in via email/password and receives a token that is required for all requests.

The site consumes an api built wite node.js using the fastify framework.  The data is housed in a mongodb.
